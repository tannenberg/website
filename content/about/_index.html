<h3>Hi, welcome to my website. I’m Marcus.</h3>
<p><br>

<br></p>
<hr />
<p>I’m a PhD Candidate at the <a href="https://www.v-dem.net/en/">V-Dem Institute</a> at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg. My research looks at self-censorship and the issues that it poses for measuring legitimacy and popular support in autocratic countries, as well as at the effects of autocratic development aid. I have also spent quite some time classifying political regimes.</p>
<p>In addition to academic research I have worked on commissioned research for the Swedish Government’s Expert Group for Aid Studies, and have together with <a href="http://www.darrelrobinson.com/">Darrel Robinson</a> worked with the UNDP Oslo Governance Center to run survey experiments in order to help UNDP develop robust measures of a number of the Sustainable Development Goals.</p>
<p>I’ll be a Visiting Graduate Student at UCSD for the fall semester of 2019.</p>
