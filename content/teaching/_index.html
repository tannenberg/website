<h3>Teaching</h3>
<p>I have taught the course <strong>Democracy and Democratization in a Comparative Perspective (SK1214)</strong> at the department of political science at the University of Gothenburg. I plan and coordinate the course together w. Anna Person, hold a couple of lectures and run several seminars throughout the semester. This course taught in Swedish and is offered twice a year. Below youâ€™ll find my lecture slides from the most recent semester:</p>
