Together with [Darrel Robinson](http://www.darrelrobinson.com/) we ran four list experiments in mainland China in 2017 in order to evaluate self-censorship on items commonly used in comparative politics to measure regime support. In short there is quite a lot of self-censorship going on, which help explain the comparatively high levels of reported regime support in China. The paper is now forthcoming in *Research & Politics*.

#### Abstract

The study of popular support for authoritarian regimes, and the comparative study of political attitudes, has long relied on the assumption that survey respondents provide truthful answers on surveys. However, when measuring regime support in closed political systems there is a distinct risk that individuals are less than forthright due to fear that their opinions may be made known to the public or the authorities. In order to test this assumption, we conducted a novel web-based survey in China in which we included four list experiments of commonly used items in the comparative literature on regime support. We find systematic bias for all four measures as a result of self- censorship; substantially more individuals state that they support the regime with direct questioning than do when presented with our anonymous, indirect list experiments. The level of self-censorship, which ranges from 16 to 22 percentage points, is considerably higher than previously thought. Self- censorship is further most prevalent among the wealthy, urban, female and younger respondents. These findings indicate that prior studies that have found high levels of support for the Chinese regime using these particular measures likely overestimate the true level of support. Further, cross- national studies which compare popular support across regime type may be systematically biased if responses are not subject to the same level of falsification across regime types.
