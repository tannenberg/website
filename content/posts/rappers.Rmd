After seeing Matthew Daniels fantastic data viz on [The Largest Vocabulary In Hip Hop](https://pudding.cool/projects/vocabulary/), in which he calculates and compares the unique number of words in rappers' first 35,000 lyrics I wanted to know how the lyrical masterminds compared in popularity. From eyeballing the data there seem to be a positive correlation between vocab size and my preference: Wutang, A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul, Beastie Boys all have well above average estimated vocabularies. But what is the relationship with rappers success on Spotify. To do this I use the Spotify API wrapper [spotifyr](https://www.rcharlie.com/spotifyr/), which allows you get artist's entire discography in seconds, along with Spotifyâ€™s audio features and track/album popularity metrics. Matthew's vocab estimates are available easily available at in a [google doc](/Users/xtanma/website). So how are the lyrical masterminds doing on Spotify? Not too too well, popular preferences are clearly negatively related to lyrical lagress. Below is the code for for interacting getting the data from Spotify and producing the graph.
