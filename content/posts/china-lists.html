<p>Together with <a href="http://www.darrelrobinson.com/">Darrel Robinson</a> we ran four list experiments in mainland China in 2017 in order to evaluate self-censorship on items commonly used in comparative politics to measure regime support. In short there is quite a lot of self-censorship going on, which help explain the comparatively high levels of reported regime support in China. The paper is published in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168019856449"><em>Research &amp; Politics</em></a>

<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>The study of popular support for authoritarian regimes has long relied on the assumption that respondents provide truthful answers to surveys. However, when measuring regime support in closed political systems there is a distinct risk that individuals are less than forthright due to fear that their opinions may be made known to the public or the authorities. In order to test this assumption, we conducted a novel web-based survey in China in which we included four list experiments of commonly used items in the comparative literature on regime support. We find systematic bias for all four measures; substantially more individuals state that they support the regime with direct questioning than when presented with our indirect list experiments. The level of self-censorship, which ranges from 24.5 to 26.5 percentage points, is considerably higher than previously thought. Self-censorship is further most prevalent among the wealthy, urban, female and younger respondents.</p>

<p>Considering confidence in the central government first, for the direct measure, 90.9% of respondents reported that they agreed with the statement: “I have confidence in the national government.” In contrast, according to the indirect, list method, only 66% of individuals reported agreement: a difference of 25 percentage points with a 95% confidence interval from 16 to 34 percentage points. For our second measure of specific support, 89.3% of our respondents agree that the government is doing its best to root out corruption with direct estimation. An estimated 63% of respondents agree with the direct statement, a 26.4 percentage point difference. The range of falsification for this item based on a 95% confidence interval is 19% to 34% of respondents.</p>
<p>The next two items relate to the diffuse dimension of system support. In direct questioning, 68.2% of respondents state that the current Chinese system is better than any other they could think of. Only 43.5% state that the Chinese system of governance is best with indirect questioning, a difference of 24.7 percentage points, with a 95% confidence interval of 16 to 34 percent of respondents. For our final sensitive item, support for government censorship, 69.8% state that they believe the government should have the right to prevent the media from publishing potentially destabilizing material. The indirect point estimate of 45% is a full 24.8 percentage points lower than the direct method estimate, with a 95% confidence interval of 16% to 34% of respondents.</p>
