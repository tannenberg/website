The release of the Varieties of Democracy Dataset version 8 means that there is new data available for updating the Regimes of the World (RoW) measure for the year 2017, plus classifying the political regime of four additional countries added in the v.8 update. Indeed, the possibility of annual updates (in addition to transparency and local expertise) was one of the impetus for why we set out to create yet another categorical measure of political regimes, which is why I am particularly glad to see the first update of RoW since our [article](https://www.cogitatiopress.com/politicsandgovernance/article/download/1214/1214) was published. So whats new?

### New countries and territories
First of all, v.8 includes data on all variables underlying the RoW measure for Bahrain, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates, and Luxembourg. While the first three are coded as Closed Autocracy, the inclusion of Luxembourg adds one additional Liberal Democracy in the RoW universe. As of 2017 there are 39 <span style="color:#5e3c99"> **Liberal Democracies** </span>, 56 <span style="color:#b2abd2"> **Electoral Democracies** </span>, 56 <span style="color:#fdb863"> **Electoral Autocracies** </span>, and 27 <span style="color:#e66101"> **Closed Autocracies** </span>" in RoW.

### Regime changes in 2017
Some 12 countries moved from one category to another between 2016 and 2017, with four countries making democratic advancements and eight countries experiencing democratic backsliding. My ambition is to go through these throughly at some point and check which one or ones of the underlying variables in the coding schema that accounts for these shifts. Although, at first glance I think most of these changes does make sense, and together they offer some additional face validity to the RoW measure.
