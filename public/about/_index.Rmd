### Hi, welcome to my website. Iâ€™m Marcus.

I'm a PhD Candidate at the [V-Dem Institute](https://www.v-dem.net/en/) at the Department of Political Science, University of Gothenburg. My research looks at self-censorship and the issues that it poses for measuring legitimacy and popular support in autocratic countries, as well as at the effects of autocratic development aid. I have also spent quite some time classifying political regimes.

In addition to academic research I have worked on commissioned research for the Swedish Government's Expert Group for Aid Studies, and have together with [Darrel Robinson](http://www.darrelrobinson.com/) worked with the UNDP Oslo Governance Center to run survey experiments in order to help UNDP develop robust measures of a number of the Sustainable Development Goals.

I'll be a Visiting Graduate Student at UCSD for the fall semester of 2019.
